# fusion-ekf-gtsam
Just make a souvenir for myself for these year's work. 
Hope this project do help to those who are majored in multiple sensor fusion fields.

## About the project
This project will apply EKF and factor graph to optimize the estimated state. It is a loosly-coupled project, fusing data from IMU, GNSS, Odometry(speed and gear status), map matching feedback, visual information and etc.
The factor graph adopts gtsam to implement.
